# otto2.0

written in node reeeeee

A rewrite of @retep's Otto iMessages bot in NodeJS

We're just doing basic framework and testing right now.

# Only runs on MacOS!
We're using MacOS 10.13 High Sierra

# Install
`npm install` should be fine


- We use [osa-imessage](https://www.npmjs.com/package/osa-imessage) to
do the things, it seems pretty great :ok_hand:

- Also [node-cmd](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-cmd) to do some
  fancy contacts lookup (if it works, idk man)
